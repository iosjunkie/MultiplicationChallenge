# MultiplicationChallenge
A fork from alemohamad but with modifications.

##### Why Fork?
- I was not sure about what to conceptualize given the hints and instruction given in this challenge. This fork, after all the lessons about animations, did not do much about animations, hence I'm giving life to it.

#### Am I learning from this?
- Well, fortunately yes! I thought I'd be just changing things here and there, but there's actually tons of things to learn in someone else's code. Some methods of his application shone some light into things that weren't clear before.
- Here I also learned that I didn't need to launch a simulator to test out this app. The canvas worked just fine. I can click buttons and go to different views.
- I've also learnt about limitations such as SegmentedPicker not being customizable at this point.

#### What I modified
- Easiest task first: Added a bottom bar in section two.
